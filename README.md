# face_recognition_schedule

This python application was realised as part of my 2nd year winter semester project. The goal of the project was to developp an application to be run on a touchscreen terminal connected to a camera for facial recognition of the students in my school. The students should be able to consult their schedule of the day after being recognized by the application (assuming they were already registered in the application database). 

Although the application is not linked to any database unless you do it manually, you still have access to the other features:

- registration of one's face with the webcam and by providing a 8 digits identifier as well as first and last names (registration menu)

- real-time recognition of the registered faces (recognition menu)

- administrators menu including database vizualisation and modification, administrator registration and the application closing protocol (you can log in with the username GPTS7 and the password 11111111 by clicking on the top right button)

- language selection: French, English and Spanish are available (the administrators menu is exclusively in French though) (bottom right button)

### Requirements

The app can only be run on Windows 10 and you need to have Python 3.8 or a later version installed on your computer.

### Installation

Click on the green button "Code" then "Download zip". After downloading the source code, unzip the files. 

### Quick start
 
You can either open the directory "face_recognition_schedule" with Pycharm or any IDE that has a Python Interpreter, or type "python main.py" in your command line (be sure to be in the "facial_recognition_schedule" directory).
